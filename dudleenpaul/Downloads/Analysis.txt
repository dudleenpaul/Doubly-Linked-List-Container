reverse() Function:
The reverse function has a complexity of O(N) because it iterates through the nodes in the list one time (atleast), and does assignments or swapping.

remove_if() Function:
The remove_if() function has a complexity of O(N) because it also iterates through the nodes in the list atleast one time. With each element pred is applied which has a constant time.
If predicate is true then it's removed. Worst case is iterating each element in the list to figure out which element is going to be remvoed.

Both also have the requirements of a copy constructor, copy assignment operator, destructer, a clear function, and an eras function in their definition.
